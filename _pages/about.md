This is Ashish! While working in software engineering for 3 years, I pondered upon Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng and since then my daily learnings have never been the same. Machine Learning or AI (as many calls it for sophistication) is a vast field that is growing exponentially even today. Hence, I am documenting my learning notes in this blog to help out people and me in future looking for answers. Reach out to me on my social handles or via email incase you have any questions or find errors. Thanks :)

If you like any of my blog or found it helpful in your ML journey, do let me know by messaging me on social media. Otherwise you could also share your appreciation by sharing the work on social media and taging me along with it. These would really encourage me to write even more quality blogs.
