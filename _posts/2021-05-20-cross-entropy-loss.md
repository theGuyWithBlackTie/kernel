title: Understanding Cross-Entropy Loss and Focal Loss
---

In this blogpost we will understand cross-entropy loss and its various different names. Later in the post, we will learn about Focal Loss, a successor of Cross-Entropy(CE) loss that performs better than CE in highly imbalanced dataset setting. We will also implement Focal Loss in PyTorch.

Cross-Entropy loss has its different names due to its different variations used in different settings but its core concept (or understanding) remains same across all the different settings.
