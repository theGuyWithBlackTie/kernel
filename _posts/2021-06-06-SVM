In Machine Learning, out of the many available supervised classification algorithms, Support Vector Machine (SVM) is one of the easiest algorithm and yet sometimes it becomes difficult to grasp. In this blog, I try to lay down my notes on unboxing the SVM blackbox and make it easy to understand in detail. This blog focusses on entirety of SVM, from its introduction to classification and kernel tricks.

The idea of SVM is simple: The algorithm creates a line or a hyperplane that separates data into different classes. Let's understand how SVM creates the hyperplane and what are its other jargon.

### What is SVM?
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised ML algorithm that can be used for classification and ***regression as well***. However, it is mostly used in classification problems. In the SVM, each data point is plotted in an **n-dimensional** space (**n** = Nos. of features). Then, classification is done by finding the hyperplane that differentiates the classes well.

In the above image, data point is plotted in 2-dimensional space and **solid black** line is the hyperplane that is able to divide the dataset in two classes viz. orange and green color.
