We have come across various articles and posts about AI being capable of producing human like speech or generating images of non-existing people that are difficult to distinguish from real-life existence. These AI systems are built upon generative adversarial networks (GANs) - which Facebook AI research director Yann LeCun called "*most interesting idea in last 10 years in ML*" GANs were introduced in a [paper](!https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) by Ian Goodfellow and other researchers at the University of Montreal, including Yoshua Bengio, in 2014.

GANs' potential for both good and evil is huge, because they can learn to mimic any distribution of data. That is, GANs can be taught to create worlds eerily similar to our own in any domain: images, music, speech, prose. They are robot artists in a sense, and their output is impressive - poignant even. But they can also be used to generate fake media content and are the technology underpinning Deepfakes.
