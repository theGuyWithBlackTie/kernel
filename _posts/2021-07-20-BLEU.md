BLEU, or Bilingual Evaluation Understudy, is a performance metric score for comparing the machine translations and human created reference translations for the same source sentence. This metric was introduced in Kishore Papineni, et al. in their 2002 paper "[BLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation](!https://aclanthology.org/P02-1040.pdf)"
