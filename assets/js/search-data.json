            "title": "Understanding Cross-Entropy Loss and Focal Loss",
            "content": "In this blogpost we will understand cross-entropy loss and its various different names. Later in the post, we will learn about Focal Loss, a successor of Cross-Entropy(CE) loss that performs better than CE in highly imbalanced dataset setting. We will also implement Focal Loss in PyTorch. . Cross-Entropy loss has its different names due to its different variations used in different settings but its core concept (or understanding) remains same across all the different settings. Cross-Entropy Loss is used in a supervised setting and before diving deep into CE, first let’s revise widely known and important concepts: . Multi-Class Classification One-of-many classification. Each data point can belong to ONE of C classes. The target (ground truth) vector t will be a one-hot vector with a positive class and C-1 negative classes. All the C classes are mutually exclusives and no two classes can be positive class. The deep learning model will have C output neurons depicting probability of each of the C class to be positive class and it is gathered in a vector s (scores). This task is treated as a single classification problem of samples in one of C classes. . Multi-Label Classification Each data point can belong to more than one class from C classes. The deep learning model will have C output neurons. Unlike in multi-class classification, here classes are not mutually exclusive. The target vector t can have more than a positive class, so it will be a vector of 0s and 1s with C dimensionality where 0 is negative and 1 is positive class. One intutive way to understand multi-label classification is to treat multi-label classification as C different binary and independent classification problem where each output neuron decides if a sample belongs to a class or not. . Output Activation Functions . These functions are transformations applied to vectors coming out from the deep learning models before the loss computation. The outputs after transformations represents probabilities of belonging to either one or more classes based on multi-class or multi-label setting. . Sigmoid It squashes a vector in the range (0,1). It is applied independently to each element of vector s. . Softmax It squashes a vector in the range (0, 1) and all the resulting elements add up to 1. It is applied to the output vector s. The Softmax activation cannot be applied independently to each element of vector s, since it depends on all elements of s. For a given class ∗si∗*s_i*∗si​∗, the Softmax function can be computed as: f(s)i=e(si)∑jCe(sj)f(s)_i = frac{e^(s_i)}{ sum_{j}^C e^(s_j)}f(s)i​=∑jC​e(sj​)e(si​)​ .",

            "title": "Adding Variable Number of Layers in Neural Network",
            "content": "Consider following code block that defines a fixed 2-layer neural network. Imagine a scenario, where the network has huge number of layers, and typing out each layer manually is just not feasible. An even more notable scenario is when the number of layers of network are not fixed and it depends on some other conigurations. This article deals with these scenarios and lays out solution. . class Net(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim): super(Net, self).__init__() linear_layer_one = nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim) linear_layer_two = nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim) def forward(self, input): output = linear_layer_two( linear_layer_one(input) ) return output . Recently, I was implementing a library related to Graph Networks in PyTorch framework. There I encountered the second scenario where the number of layers in the neural network were not fixed and it network required number of layers to be added as an input. The user of the library would specify how many layers is required as the input and that many layers would be added in the neural network. . As a daily user of Python, my first solution was to use a list data structure with a for loop to add n-number of layers, like below code block. . class Net(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim, nos_linear_layer): super(Net, self).__init__() self.nn_layers = [] for i in range(0,nos_linear_layer): linear_layer = nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim) self.nn_layers.append(linear_layer) def forward(self, input): outputs = None for i,layer in enumerate(self.nn_layers): outputs = layer(input) outputs = torch.nn.functional.Softmax(outputs, 1) return outputs . Above code would look correct and would be expected to run without any issue. But, the main issue is that the linear layers stored in Python list would not be trained. On calling model.parameters(), PyTorch would simply ignore the parameters of linear layers stored in the Python list. . The correct way is to use PyTorch’s list nn.ModuleList. . class Net(nn.Module): def __init__(self, input_dim, output_dim, nos_linear_layer): super(Net, self).__init__() self.nn_layers = nn.ModuleList() for i in range(0,nos_linear_layer): linear_layer = nn.Linear(input_dim, output_dim) self.nn_layers.append(linear_layer) def forward(self, input): outputs = None for i,layer in enumerate(self.nn_layers): outputs = layer(input) outputs = torch.nn.functional.Softmax(outputs, 1) return outputs .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
